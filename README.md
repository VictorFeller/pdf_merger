# pdf_merger
A simple Python script to merge multiple pdf files.

I was tired of always having to upload my files to different online tools to do so.

So.. here is a very simple script based on PyPDF2.

1) Move the script in the folder where your pdf files are situated

2) Execute the script (need Python 3 installed and PyPDF2 installed (py -m pip install PyPDF2))
3) 
4.1) If using the  python_merger_with_recto_option script, choose if you want to add a blank page in order to start each PDF as the recto page.

3) Every single pdf file in the folder will be merged into the new "combined.pdf" file
